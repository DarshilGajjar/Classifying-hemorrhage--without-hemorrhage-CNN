# Hemorrhage Detection
## Introduction  
In this project I have used a convolutional neural network architecture to classify patients with hemorrhage by using head CT images. Talking about the dataset that I have used for this project consists of Healthy patients classified as "Normal" and patients suffering from hemorrhage classified as "Hemorrhage".
